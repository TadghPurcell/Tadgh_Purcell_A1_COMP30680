        <h1>Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu</h1>
        <p>
          Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ), known as the "gentle art" is a combat sport
          that focuses on ground fighting and submission grappling. It
          emphasizes technique and leverage, allowing a smaller, weaker person
          to defend themselves against a larger opponent in a gentle manner.
        </p>

      <div class="hobbies-history">
        <h1>History of BJJ</h1>
        <p>
          Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) traces its roots to Japanese Jujutsu and
          Judo, which were introduced to Brazil in the early 20th century. In
          the 1920s, a Japanese judoka named Mitsuyo Maeda migrated to Brazil
          and began teaching martial arts. One of his students, Carlos Gracie,
          and Carlos' younger brother Hélio adapted and further developed these
          techniques, eventually founding Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu. The Gracie family
          played a pivotal role in refining and popularizing BJJ, organizing
          competitions to showcase its effectiveness. Below is a short video
          made by Rener Gracie, who is Hélio's grandson about the history of
          BJJ.

            <p class="hobbies-list--item--sub">
              BJJ is a full-body workout that enhances strength, flexibility,
              and cardiovascular fitness. The constant movement, grappling, and
              sparring engage various muscle groups, promoting overall physical
              well-being.

            <h3>Practical Self-Defense:</h3>
            <p class="hobbies-list--item--sub">
              BJJ is a martial art with a strong focus on practical
              self-defense. The techniques taught in BJJ empower individuals to
              defend themselves in real-life situations.

            <h3>Mental Acuity and Discipline:</h3>
            <p class="hobbies-list--item--sub">
              The mental aspect of BJJ is equally important. It's like a
              physical chess game, requiring strategic thinking,
              problem-solving, and quick decision-making. Learning and
              implementing intricate techniques foster mental acuity and
              discipline.

              BJJ is inclusive and adaptable. Practitioners of all ages, sizes,
              and fitness levels can participate and benefit. It's not about
              overpowering opponents but using technique and leverage
              effectively, making it an art accessible to a diverse range of
              people.

            <h3>Community and Camaraderie:</h3>
            <p class="hobbies-list--item--sub">
              The BJJ community often emphasizes respect, humility, and
              camaraderie. It's a sport that encourages mutual growth and
              learning, creating a supportive environment for practitioners to
              develop not only as athletes but also as individuals.
