I have included links to my own page in the navbar and external pages in my contact page where I linked my github and linkedin.
I included the navbar at the top of each page.
I have included a table in the hobbies page listing belt rankings for BJJ.
I have included two lists and an embedded video in the hobbies page also, an ordered and unordered list.
I have used lots of CSS3 elements such as display flex and grid and there respective features, and other elements such as border radius.
I have used HTML5 features such as nav, main, footer and embed.
I have used block and inline elements throughout my page including some spans and links for inline elements.
I have used media queries which I learned how to use from the odin project and its resources such as W3 schools, I also used this to learn about flex and grid layouts and I used youtube channels such as web dev simplified and kevin powell CSS to further understand some properties/elements used on my webpage.
